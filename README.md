## 👋 Hi, I'm Martin Joshy!



"I don't know everything but I can learn anything", I think that is my life moto.

I started my career in hospitality but was more interested in computers where I would spend most of my time trying to automate things because I was too lazy to work and was fascinated by the amount of work a computer could do.

Later on I decided to take a huge bet in my life to learn Software development and here I am loving every moment of my job and enjoying my life.

Right now I am a web developer and I don't limit myself to any stack or any language, I would rather see it as an opportunity to learn something beautiful which the smartest of people have made and build something beautiful which anyone can enjoy.

Right now I am personally working and understanding Linux which is my quest to reach the lowest level in computers.

Don't know if my bio makes sense but if it does let's connect and build something great!!
